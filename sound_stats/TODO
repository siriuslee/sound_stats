Goals:

To develop tools to study the statistics of sounds of different categories

We need to three main parts:
Input representations
Embeddings
Analyses

For input representations:
Spectrogram
Cochleagram
Mel Spectrogram
MFCC

All should be implemented as their own objects such that they can be easily swapped
They need the methods:
load
save
compute

For Embeddings:
Deep network
Deep convolutional (in time) network
Deep recurrent network

They need the methods:
fit
evaluate
load
save

I'd like all compute methods to have a wrapper that submits them to a cluster to run
